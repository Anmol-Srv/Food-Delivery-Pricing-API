# Food Delivery Pricing API

The Food Delivery Pricing API is a comprehensive solution designed to address the dynamic pricing needs of food delivery services. By leveraging this API, businesses can automatically calculate delivery charges based on several critical factors, including the type of food item (perishable or non-perishable), the delivery distance, and the specific delivery zone. This API aims to enhance the operational efficiency of food delivery services by providing a scalable and adaptable pricing model that can be tailored to the unique requirements of each delivery scenario. Deployed on Render.com, the API offers robustness and reliability, ensuring seamless integration and consistent performance for all users.

## Features

The Food Delivery Pricing API offers a suite of features designed to provide flexible, dynamic pricing solutions for food delivery services. Key features include:

- **Dynamic Pricing Calculation**: Automatically computes delivery costs by considering the distance to the delivery destination, the type of item being delivered (perishable vs. non-perishable), and the delivery zone, ensuring accurate pricing for each order.

- **Perishable and Non-Perishable Item Support**: Distinct pricing models for perishable and non-perishable items, recognizing the unique requirements and urgency associated with transporting different types of food.

- **Zone-Based Pricing Configuration**: Allows for the customization of delivery charges based on predefined zones, enabling businesses to adjust pricing based on delivery area specifics.

- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to efficiently handle a high volume of pricing calculations, ensuring scalability and reliability even during peak demand periods.

- **Comprehensive API Documentation**: Detailed documentation available through Swagger UI, providing clear instructions for integrating and utilizing the API, along with interactive examples to test and explore API endpoints.

- **Secure and Reliable**: Hosted on Render.com, offering robust security features and high availability to ensure the API is always accessible when needed.


## Technologies and Libraries

The Food Delivery Pricing API is built on a robust stack of technologies and libraries, ensuring high performance, ease of integration, and developer-friendly documentation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the core components:

## Database Design

This application uses PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source object-relational database system, to store and manage data efficiently. Below is an overview of the database schema, including tables and their relationships.

Based on the details provided and the associations mentioned, here's the corrected Markdown code for the **Tables** and **Relationships** sections, including some missing details and corrections to align with the database models and associations you've defined:

---

### Tables

- **Organizations**
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `name`: Name of the organization
  - Description: Stores information about different organizations using the delivery service.

- **Items**
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `type`: Type of item (perishable or non-perishable)
  - `description`: Description of the item
  - Description: Catalogues items being delivered.

- **Pricings**
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `organization_id`: Foreign key referencing Organizations
  - `item_id`: Foreign key referencing Items
  - `zone`: Name of the delivery zone
  - `base_distance_in_km`: Base distance threshold for standard pricing
  - `km_price`: Price per kilometer beyond the base distance
  - `fix_price`: Fixed price for delivery within the base distance
  - Description: Defines pricing rules based on zones and item types.

### Relationships

- **Organizations to Pricings**: One-to-Many. An organization can have multiple pricing rules, allowing for customization of pricing based on organizational needs.

- **Items to Pricings**: One-to-Many. A specific item type can have different pricing rules, accommodating variations in delivery costs based on item characteristics.

## Testing Suite

This project is equipped with a comprehensive suite of tests, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the Food Delivery Pricing API. The tests are built using Jest, a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

### Running the Tests

To run the test suite, ensure you have all dependencies installed and then use the following npm script defined in `package.json`:

```bash
npm test
```

This command sets the `NODE_ENV` to `test`, ensuring that the tests are run in the correct environment, and executes Jest with the `--detectOpenHandles` flag to help identify potential issues with lingering connections or processes.

### Test Configuration

The Jest configuration is specified in the `jest.config.js` file, which includes settings optimized for this project's testing needs. This configuration ensures that Jest correctly locates and executes the test files, and it integrates well with other tools and libraries used in the project.

### Test Files

Tests are organized into files corresponding to the application components they target. For example:

- `validationErrors.test.js`: Tests API input validation and error handling.
- `pricingCalculation.test.js`: Focuses on testing the logic for calculating delivery prices.
- `databaseErrors.test.js`: Ensures the application gracefully handles database errors.

Each test file contains multiple test cases designed to cover a wide range of scenarios and edge cases.
